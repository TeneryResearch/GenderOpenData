# Introduction

You are here to help on [GenderOpenData.org](https://genderopendata.org)? Awesome, feel welcome and read the following
sections in order to know what and how to work on something. If you get stuck
at any point you can create a ticket on
[GitHub](https://github.com/CWRAdvocacy/GenderOpenData/issues/).

All members of our community are expected to follow our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please make
sure you are welcoming and friendly in all of our spaces.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing
changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Types of Contributions

You can contribute in many ways. For example, you might:

* Add documentation and "how-to" articles in the [README](README.md) or the wiki
* Suggest Enhancements
* Fix issues
* Submit Bug reports

### Bug Reports

*If you find a security vulnerability, **DO NOT** open an issue. Email
[security@cwra.africa](mailto:security@cwra.africa) instead.*

If you're reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* If you can, provide detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
* If you don't have steps to reproduce the bug, just note your observations in
  as much detail as you can. Questions to start a discussion about the issue
  are welcome.

### Writing Documentation

Did you find a typo? Do you think that something should be clarified? Go ahead
and suggest a documentation patch. The GenderOpenData deployment could always use more documentation,
whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog
posts, wiki, articles, and such.

### Fixing Issues

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" is open to
whoever wants to implement it.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check the issues list as you
might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an
enhancement suggestion fill out an
issue and [label](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-label/) the issue as a
new feature.

## Your first contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to GenderOpenData? You can start by looking through
these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* `Beginner issues` - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a
    test or two.
* `Help wanted issues` - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner
    issues.

Once your changes and tests are ready to submit for review:

1. Test your changes

    Run the tests if you have any and at the bare minimum, test your changes
    manually.

2. Rebase your changes

    Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main GenderOpenData
    repository, and rebase your branch on top of the latest develop branch.

3. Submit a pull request

    Push your local changes to your forked copy of the repository and submit a
    pull request. In the pull request, choose a title which sums up the changes
    that you have made, and in the body provide more details about what your
    changes do. Also mention the number of the issue where discussion has taken
    place. Preferably use our PR template.

    Then sit back and wait. There will probably be discussion about the pull
    request and, if any changes are needed, we would love to work with you to
    get your pull request merged into GenderOpenData.

## Code Style

Please adhere to the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Coding
conventions for the Python language. This style guide evolves over time as
additional conventions are identified and past conventions are rendered obsolete
by changes in the language itself. Ensure to keep updated.
